Ex1:
Minor: V\X -> V\S

Ex2:
TOOOOOO LONG! Anyway I think this is also correct.

Ex4:
I think in 2, it is at least 1 instead of more than 1. There is something else I think is not correct: T is some MST instead of a MST constructed by Kruscal. Do not think about any algorithm generating MST, think about MST itself.

Ex7:
The same comments as in Ex4, namely consider MST itself instead of generated from any algorithm.

Ex10:
I think this number is incorrect...
