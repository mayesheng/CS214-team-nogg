Ex9
Minor comment: there is something you count twice, basically around j<i=k and k = j < i. You count it in the middle, also on left/right side.
This is quite complicate computation in Ex9.

Ex4:
The path connecting u and v is not only in T, there might be other paths connecting them, which you should give a proof for those paths.

Ex1
The description can not regard as a proof. 

Ex4
It may be a typo that "the source and destination of this graph are vout and s". What does the v_out mean here?  (But you do not lose credit here)

Ex5
It is not obviously that the vertex matched in the last level can be matched in the next level. Especially when i > n/2.

Ex6 
The weight between s and the second layer should not be 2, since this will let edges have two orientation. If an edge has two orientation, and the final orientation edges number is |E|, it will not return a feasible solution. Since the solution can be an edge has two orientation, another edge has no orientation.
