\textbf{Solution 1:}\\
\textbf{Exercise 1}
\begin{sol}\\
Let's denote all the vertices, except s and t, as $e_i$ where i is in range of 1 and n-2.
\begin{enumerate}
\item\textbf{right-most:}\\
The whole process is like this:\\
1. In the beginning, s.h = n while others' heights are all 0. And only $e_1$ is overflowing, $e_1.e$ is n-1.
	\begin{figure}[H]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=7cm]{1.png}
	\caption{Initialization}
	\end{figure}
2. Among all the vertices with height 0(except vertex t), choose the right-most overflowing one. If the chosen one is t, goto 4 else relabel it by setting its height to 1, then goto 3.\\
3. Push ($e_i$,$e_{i+1}$), where $e_i$ is the chosen one in 2. Because that $e_i.e$ is one more that $c_f(e_i,e_{i+1})$, the result is that now $e_i.e$ is 1 and $f(e_i,e_{i+1})$ is n-i-1, and then $e_{i+1}$ is overflowing. Goto 2.\\
	\begin{figure}[H]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=7cm]{2.png}
	\caption{Choose e1}
	\end{figure}
4. Now the situation is that all vertices, except s and t,  have height 1. s.h = n, t.h = 0. And except s, all vertices have excess 1.\\
	\begin{figure}[H]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=7cm]{3.png}
	\caption{situation described in 4}
	\end{figure}
5. Among all the vertices with height 1, choose the right-most one(it must be overflowing), if it's $e_1$, goto 7 else relabel it  by setting its height to 2, goto 6.\\
6. Push ($e_{i+1}$,$e_i$), where $e_{i+1}$ is the chosen one in 5. Then the result is $e_{i+1}$ is not overflowing, $e_i.e$ is n-i-1, and $f(e_i,e_{i+1})$ is 1. Then goto 5.\\
7. If the chosen one in 5 is $e_1$, then relabel it by setting its height to 3. Push ($e_i$,$e_2$) and now $e_1.e$ is 1 and $e_2.e$ is n-3. $f(e_1,e_2)$ is n-2.\\
Then after repeating this process 2-7 by [n/2] times, we come to one of these situations(depending on n is even or odd):\\
Before that let's count the push-relabel steps so far. \\
Each action in 2, 3, 5, 6 needs one step, and action in 7 needs 2 steps. And remenber, after the first 2-7 round, each time when we choose $e_{n-2}$ in 2, we can't just lift it by one but by two.\\
So the total action steps is [n/2]*2*(2n-6)+4=(4n-12)*[n/2]+4.\\
\textbf{if n is even:}\\
	\begin{figure}[H]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=7cm]{4.png}
	\caption{After 7 when n is even}
	\end{figure}
Now all vertices except $e_1$ and t have height n. $e_1.h$ is n+1, $t.h$ is 0. We can still push($e_1$,$s$). Since $e_1.e$ is 1, and $c_f(e_1,s)$ is n-1, after pushing we get: $f(s,e_1)$ is n-2 and $e_1$ is not overflowing.\\
Then repeat process 2-6, and we get: ($e_1.e$ is n-2)\\
	\begin{figure}[H]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=7cm]{5.png}
	\caption{Before the final step}
	\end{figure}
Now we can push($e_1,s$) and get the final result.\\
Total steps is (4n-12)*[n/2]+4+1(the push at first)+2*(2n-7)+1(the last push)=2$n^2$-2n-8.\\
\textbf{if n is odd:}\\
	\begin{figure}[H]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=7cm]{6.png}
	\caption{After 7 when n is odd}
	\end{figure}
Now all vertices except s, $e_1$ and t have height n-1. s.h and $e_1.h$ are both n, t.h is 0.\\
Then repeat process 2-6 and we get:($e_1.e$ is n-2)\\
	\begin{figure}[H]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=7cm]{7.png}
	\caption{Before the final step}
	\end{figure}
Now we can lift $e_1$ by 1 and push($e_1,s$) and get the final result.\\
Total steps is  (4n-12)*[n/2]+4+2*(2n-6)=2$n^2$-4n-2.\\
\textbf{After all:}the result is (4n-12)*[n/2]+(4n-8).
\item\textbf{left-most:}\\
The whole process is like this:\\
1. In the beginning, s.h = n while others' heights are all 0. And only $e_1$ is overflowing, $e_1.e$ is n-1.\\
2. Among all the vertices with height 0(except vertex t), choose the left-most overflowing one. If the chosen one is t, goto 6 else relabel it by setting its height to 1, then goto 3.\\
3. Push ($e_i$,$e_{i+1}$), where $e_i$ is the chosen one in 2. Because that $e_i.e$ is one more that $c_f(e_i,e_{i+1})$, the result is that now $e_i.e$ is 1 and $f(e_i,e_{i+1})$ is n-i-1, and then $e_{i+1}$ is overflowing. Goto 4.\\
	\begin{figure}[H]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=7cm]{8.png}
	\caption{Choose e1}
	\end{figure}
4. Relabel $e_i$ by setting its height to n+i, goto 5.\\
5. Push($e_i$,$e_{i-1}$), push($e_{i-1}$,$e_{i-2}$)...until push($e_1$,s). Now we get that the the first i vertices are not overflowing. Goto to 2.\\
6. Now this is the final situation.\\
	\begin{figure}[H]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=7cm]{9.png}
	\caption{Final State}
	\end{figure}
Total steps are: $\sum_{i=1}^{n-2}(3+i)$=$\frac{n^2+3n-10}{2}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{sol}

\textbf{Solution 2:}\\
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Since in a cycle of $n$ edges, a mincut can only contain $2$ edges
    and we can choose the $2$ edges from $n$ edges. Thus the number of
        mincuts in a $C_n$ should be $\binom{n}{2}$
\item Suppose we there are $m$ different global mincuts. For the Karger's algorithm, the probability of each global mincut
    should be $\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}$ and since these are all disjoint events we get:
        \[
            \sum_{1}^{m} \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \leq 1
            \]
        Thus we get that the max kinds of mincut should be $\binom{n}{2}$.

\item Simply consider that for $s$, we have $v_1, v_2 \ldots v_n$ connected to $s$ and we also have these
    $v_1, v_2 \ldots v_n$ connected to $t$. Since $s$ and $t$ has to be in different $S$ and $\overline{S}$,
    we can arbitrarily take $v_i$ to $S$ or $\overline{S}$ without changing the value of mincut, which should be $n$.
    In this we, we the total number of mincuts should be $2^n$, which is a exponential number.
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Exercise 3.}
\begin{sol}

Here is the example based on which we cannot find a maximum cut from the modified Stoer-Wagner algorithm. This is the initial undirected-weighted graph.\\
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{1.eps}
\end{figure}

Based on the modified algorithm, we will choose the least tightly connected vertex.\\
So we choose vertex from 1 vertex.\\
And the cut phase will be {1, 2, 4} {3}. In the meantime, the weight is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8. And we merge the vertex 4 and 3. The remaining graph is as followed.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{2.eps}
\end{figure}

And continuing, the cut phase will be {1, 2} {3 4}. The weight is 3 + 4 = 7. And merge 2 and 3 4. The remaining graph is as followed.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.1\linewidth]{3.eps}
\end{figure}

The weight is 5.\\
As a result, the max weight we get from the modified algorithm is 8. However, if we consider the cut {1, 4} and {2, 3}, the weight is 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 10. So the result is wrong. So the modified Stoer-Wagner Algorithm fails to find the maximum cut.\\
\end{sol}
