Yeah it is correct. Actually when n is odd numbers, this is also almost correct.

Ex2
Correct.

Ex3
You are providing some evidences, not a full proof. You should proof that for any algorithm, it is intractable.

Ex4
I think your first construction is correct. You only need one more sentence to say your solution takes that long time.

Ex5
Correct.

Ex6
Correct. Glad to see that you mentioned quickselect is a function with k as input, which Dominik didn't mention in Ex6.

Ex7
I don't think this is correct.

Ex8
I think so.

Ex9
Since your Ex7 is incorrect, this is also wrong. Actually this calculation is quite complicate.
